## Connectome Differences

**Analysis Plan**

We know that GSP1000MF and Yeo1000 differ importantly in their connectivity at the posterior medulla. Most of the other differences are in the ventricles, cisterns, and CSF spaces. 

We want to determine whether we believe GSP1000MF or Yeo1000. 

We can use Biancardi's reports to help us determine brain connectivity for relevant medullary nuclei. 

Then, we want to study CSF connectivity in the ventricles and cisterns to see if we believe GSP1000MF or Yeo1000.

We can also supplement our analysis using the ABCD connectome data.
